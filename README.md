# Awkward Ratings for Android - v. 0.1

Simple app that uses the REST APIs documented on <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">www.themoviedb.org</a>. 
Specifically, it asks for the day's most popular movies. Results are presented in an endless RecyclerView.  

App demonstrates the use of REST APIs via <a href="http://square.github.io/retrofit/">Retrofit</a>, image gathering/caching via <a href="http://square.github.io/picasso/">Picasso</a>, and coloring each list item based on the image using the AppCompat-v7 Palette class.  

<b>The app requires an API key from themoviedb.org in order to be used correctly.</b>  

If you wish to try out the app, just download and install Awkward-Ratings.apk in the root folder.
